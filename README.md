# Camera-based-ADAS
This project is a part of Computer Vision course at Innopolis University - Spring 23

## Idea: 
ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) are passive and active safety systems designed to remove the human error component when operating vehicles of many types. 
In this project I am focusing on the following tasks: 
1. Advanced lane finding 
2. Detecting other vehicles 
3. Tracking other vehicles: For this task [Deep Sort] (https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort) will be used which is based on [Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric] (https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07402)
