# Camera-based-ADAS
This project is a part of Computer Vision course at Innopolis University - Spring 23

## Idea: 
ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) are passive and active safety systems designed to remove the human error component when operating vehicles of many types. 
In this project I am focusing on the following tasks: 
1. Advanced lane finding : 
2. Detecting other vehicles : YOLO will be used for this task, no modification will be made as it already trained on class cars.
3. Tracking other vehicles: for this task [Deep Sort](https://github.com/nwojke/deep_sort) will be used which is based on [Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07402)
