# Camera-based-ADAS
This project is a part of Computer Vision course at Innopolis University - Spring 23

## Idea: 
ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance Systems) are passive and active safety systems designed to remove the human error component when operating vehicles of many types. 
In this project I am focusing on the following tasks: 
1. Advanced lane finding 
2. Detecting other vehicles 
3. tracking other vehicles
